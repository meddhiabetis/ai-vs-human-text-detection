# Human vs AI Text Detection

This is a web application that detects whether a given text is written by a human or generated by AI. The project uses a BERT-based NLP model for classification, which was trained to differentiate between human-written and AI-generated text.

## Features

- Enter a text into a text area.
- The application predicts whether the text is AI-generated or human-written.
- Displays confidence percentage for the prediction.
- Provides a user-friendly interface with real-time feedback.
- Includes a loading indicator while the prediction is being processed.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Django
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Model**: BERT (Pre-trained on AI vs Human text classification)
- **Deployment**: Can be run locally or deployed to a server

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   cd your-repository
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run Django migrations:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```
4. Start the Django server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```
5. Open your browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ to use the application.

- **Model Download:** The BERT model used in this project can be downloaded from this [Kaggle link](https://www.kaggle.com/code/betismeddhia/human-vs-ai-text-detection-with-advanced-nlp/output). Place the downloaded bert_model folder in the model/ directory.
